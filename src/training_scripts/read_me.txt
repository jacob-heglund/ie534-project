After opening up an interactive job,
follow the instructions in running_on_BW.txt.

Use the MsPacman_BWReady.py file as a template to create any new game files.
-Change the env_id
-Change the number of frames (eg. for Pong, we may only want 5,000,000 frames)

Place all adam.py, optimizer.py, torch_siz.py, and wrappers.py in the same directory as the game script.
